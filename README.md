### Features : 
- Cool driving, almost "Like a Boss" Style.
- You can take 7 year old revenge by playing this game with others.
- Great way to use 1000 GB of data in 30 mins, other than dowloading GTA V for 20 times using NASA's internet.
- No need of driving licence, as the creators themselves don't have one.
- You can play this game by sitting anywhere.... (Toilet, middle of road, etc) People will be ready to join you.
- All you need to do is be a stupid driver, your dad may never give his car to drive after this game.
- A garage scene that doesn't work.
- Nothing else, fully enjoyable game :)
