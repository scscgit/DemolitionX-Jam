# Demolition X 

Experience the ultimate form of destruction! Welcome to the online car demolition arena, where your goal is to survive as long as possible, gaining additional score for any damage dealt by jamming your opponents.

ðŸš« There is no active development on this project anymore! ðŸš«

### Features : 
- Cool driving, almost "Like a Boss" Style.
- You can take 7 year old revenge by playing this game with others.
- Great way to use 1000 GB of data in 30 mins, other than dowloading GTA V for 20 times using NASA's internet.
- No need of driving licence, as the creators themselves don't have one.
- You can play this game by sitting anywhere.... (Toilet, middle of road, etc) People will be ready to join you.
- All you need to do is be a stupid driver, your dad may never give his car to drive after this game.
- A garage scene that doesn't work.
- Nothing else, fully enjoyable game :)
